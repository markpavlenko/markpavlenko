# Hey! My name's Mark ðŸ¤—
## About me ðŸ¤“
I'm Mark Pavlenko, from Ukraine, Kyiv.

I created lot's of projects, like PyTermOS.

I love both Front-End and Back-End. I know HTML and CSS very well, and know Python.

## My projects ðŸ¤©
I've created lot's of projects.

markpavlenko.github.io - a website about me so you can see my projects and stuff 'bout me.

PMDMcalc - a calculator on python that runs in a terminal window.

PyTerm - a custom terminal with PMDMcalc and lot's of features. It was discontinued due to the creation of PyTermOS.

RandomCarrot - a module for Python that can generate random letters and numbers. Was also discontinued, because of small activity.

desktop.chatgpt - an app that let's you use ChatGPT on your Mac. A new official ChatGPT Desktop app was released, but only for MacOS Sonoma and desktop.chatgpt let's you use it on any MacOS.

And PyTermOS, a Linux distro that uses the PyTerm CLI interface, only for RPi hardware.

## On what i'm working now ðŸ˜Ž
PyTermOS. I'm working on PyTermOS now for 4 weeks now. 

It's not working now (Kernel Panic issues) and i'm working on it.
